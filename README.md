If the HMA is rising, the prevailing trend is rising, indicating it may be better to enter long positions. If the HMA is falling, the prevailing trend is also falling, indicating it may be better to enter short positions.

Like any other moving average, if the HMA is rising along with price, it indicates an uptrend. Conversely, if the HMA is falling along with price, it indicates a downtrend.

Traders can take a long position if prices are rising and the HMA is trending upwards. However, traders can take a short position, if the prevailing trend is falling.
